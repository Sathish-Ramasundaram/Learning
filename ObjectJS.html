let car = { color: "blue", make: "Toyota", model: "Camry" };
This is a JavaScript statement that defines an object

let: This is a JavaScript keyword used to declare a variable. 
let creates a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned later.

car: This is the variable name you've chosen for your object. It will hold the entire object definition.

color is the key (or property name).
"blue" is the value associated with the color key.

make: "Toyota": Another property, where make is the key and "Toyota" is the value.
model: "Camry": Another property, where model is the key and "Camry" is the value.

"Car Color: ": This is a string literal. It's the fixed text part of the message you want to display.
+: This is the concatenation operator. In JavaScript, when used with strings, it joins them together.

car.color: This accesses the color property of the car object you defined earlier. 
It will evaluate to the string "blue".
