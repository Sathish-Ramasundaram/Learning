<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>

    <p id="output"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('output').textContent = "Hello World!";
    </script>

<!-- 
p - paragraph

id="output" - Attribute
The id attribute provides a unique identifier for an HTML element within the entire document. 
No two elements on the same page should have the same id value.
In this specific case, giving the paragraph the id of "output" makes it easy for JavaScript to find and interact with this particular paragraph. 
When JavaScript uses document.getElementById('output'), it's looking for exactly this element by its unique ID.

<script> - JavaScript code
used to embed or reference executable code, most commonly JavaScript.
So, while <script> itself is an HTML element, its primary purpose is to contain or link to JavaScript code.
<script>
    // --- JavaScript Code Starts Here ---
    // ... your JavaScript code ...
    // --- JavaScript Code Ends Here ---
</script>

document - built in, global JavaScript object that represents the entire HTML document loaded in the browser. 
It's your main entry point to interact with the web page's structure, content, and style. 

.getElementById('output'):
This is a method (a function associated with an object) of the document object.
Its purpose is to find an HTML element within the document that has an id attribute matching the string provided in the parentheses (in this case, 'output').
In your HTML, you have <p id="output"></p>, so this part successfully locates that specific paragraph element.

.textContent:
This is a property of an HTML element object (like the one returned by getElementById).
It represents the plain text content inside that HTML element, ignoring any HTML tags within it.
When you use it on the left side of an assignment (=), you are setting or changing the text content of that element.

"Hello World!" is simply a string literal â€“ the actual text you want to display.
