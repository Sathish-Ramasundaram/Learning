<!--
type="button" generic clickable button 
"generic" implies that it's a blank slate for your JavaScript code to define its purpose.
Here's why it's called generic:
type="submit": This button type specifically tells the browser to submit the form it's part of when clicked. This is a non-generic, predefined behavior.
type="reset": This button type specifically tells the browser to reset all the form fields to their initial values when clicked. This is also a non-generic, predefined behavior.
type="button": This type simply creates a clickable button that does nothing by default. It's "generic" because it doesn't come with any pre-wired actions. You, as the developer, are expected to attach custom behavior to it using JavaScript (like your onclick attribute to display the date and time).

onclick: 
This is a standard HTML event attribute. 
It's how you tell the browser to execute JavaScript code when the element is clicked.

document: 
This is a standard, built-in JavaScript object that represents the entire HTML document 
(the Document Object Model, or DOM). 
You'll almost always start with document when interacting with elements on the page.

.getElementById(): This is a standard JavaScript method available on the document object. 
Its purpose is to find an HTML element by its unique id.

.innerHTML: 
This is a standard JavaScript property of an HTML element. 
It's used to get or set the HTML content inside an element.
innerHTML represents the HTML content (including any HTML tags) inside an element. 
When you assign a value to innerHTML, it replaces the existing content of that element with the new value, and if the new value contains HTML tags, the browser will render those tags.

Why this name? 
The name innerHTML literally means "the HTML content that is inside this element." 
It distinguishes itself from other properties like outerHTML (which includes the element's own tag) or textContent (which only deals with plain text).

Both innerHTML and textContent will correctly display plain text.

The difference between innerHTML and textContent becomes crucial when the content you are setting or getting contains HTML tags:
If you set element.innerHTML = "<b>Hello</b> World!", the browser will render "Hello" in bold.
If you set element.textContent = "<b>Hello</b> World!", the browser will literally display the string "<b>Hello</b> World!" (including the <b> tags) as plain text, without rendering "Hello" in bold.
Since Date() only provides plain text, either innerHTML or textContent works equally well for displaying the date and time.

Date(): 
This is a standard, built-in JavaScript function/constructor that returns a string representation of the current date and time.
