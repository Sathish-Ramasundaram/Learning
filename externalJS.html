<!--
defer : f the defer attribute is eliminated from <script src="script.js" defer></script>, the code will not produce the output correctly in your current setup.

If your JavaScript needs to interact with HTML elements that appear later in the HTML document:
You must either use the defer attribute on your <script> tag (which tells the browser to run the script after the HTML is parsed).
OR, you must place your <script> tag at the very end of the <body> section, just before </body>. This ensures all HTML elements are parsed and available before the script runs.
