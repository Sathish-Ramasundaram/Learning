<!--
const:
This is a JavaScript keyword used to declare a variable.
When you declare a variable with const, it means:
It's a constant reference: Once you assign a value to it, you cannot reassign it to a different value later in the code. 
In this case, colorDisplayElement will always refer to the HTML <p> element with id="carColorDisplay".

It cannot be redeclared: You cannot use const colorDisplayElement again in the same scope. 
This is why your previous code had an error when you tried to declare displayElement twice.

Usefulness of const: It helps prevent accidental reassignments and makes your code more predictable. 
If you know a variable's reference won't change, const is the preferred way to declare it.

colorDisplayElement:
This is the variable name you chose.
It's a descriptive name that tells you what the variable holds.

Its use is to store a reference to the HTML element that document.getElementById('carColorDisplay') returns.

By storing this reference, you can then perform multiple operations on that specific HTML element without having to repeatedly call document.getElementById('carColorDisplay') every single time.
