<!--
you cannot use document.write() to target a specific paragraph by its id in the same way you use document.getElementById('id').

Here's why:
document.write() writes directly into the HTML output stream. It doesn't interact with elements that have already been rendered and are part of the Document Object Model (DOM). 
If you call document.write() after the page has loaded, it will erase all existing content on the page and replace it with what you're writing.

document.getElementById('id') is part of the DOM API. 
It allows JavaScript to find and manipulate specific, already existing elements on the page. 
When you use it with .textContent or .innerHTML, you are updating only that targeted element, leaving the rest of the document intact.

So, document.write() is for inserting content during the initial page load, while document.getElementById() is for modifying content on a page that has already loaded. 
They serve different purposes and cannot be interchanged in that manner.-->
